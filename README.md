# Login Form
 
This was supposed to be a login form, but I tried do just do a note taking app only to show some tricks you can do with the react library!

This repo is basically the frontend of the app using React + Chakra UI, if you're curios about the backend check my other repo located at: *https://github.com/jphinning/apiRest-* <--- Made with Express + MongoDB

*Please take a look at https://zen-minsky-b39ab6.netlify.app/ to see the app in action*

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the app.

```bash
npm install
```
